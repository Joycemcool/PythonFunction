#create large, powerful, and virtually bug-free code bases
#the code are easy to test and modify
#declarative style programming
# voice input #windows+h 
#immutability separating functions and data first class functions
# in a function the variables are immutable brand of valuable is given value is always the same
# most valuables in functions are treated as a constant
#treat function as value, number...list, combine existing functions to create new function
